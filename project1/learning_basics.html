              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Positioning:</b> Position yourself in a balanced stance with your feet shoulder-width apar. Bend your kness slightly to get ready to move.</li>
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Hand Placement:</b> Form a platform with your forearms by clasping your hands together, with your thumbs parallel to each other and your arms straight out in front of you, creating a flat surface for the ball to rebound off.</li>
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Contact Path:</b> Try to position yourself in the middle of the ball path so the ball meets the forearms between your wrists and elbows.</li>

            <ul class = "list-group list_style mt-1">
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Positioning:</b> Start by positioning yourself (or your forehead) underneath the ball, with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. Face your target and square shoulders to ensure accuracy.</li>
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Hand Placement:</b> Raise both hands above your head, forming a triangular shape with your thumbs and index fingers. Keep fingers spread apart to create a large surface area for contacting the ball.</li>
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Contact Path:</b> Position yourself to make contact with it at its highest point. Aim to contact the ball with fingertips slightly above forehead to achieve maximum control and accuracy.</li>
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Contact Point:</b> Use your fingertips to cushion the ball upon contact, giving it a soft touch to set it up for your teammate. Avoid too much force because it can result in an inaccurate and unpredictable set. After making contact, continue your arm motion in teh direction of your target to ensure a smooth and fluid set.</li>

            <ul class = "list-group list_style mt-1">
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Approach:</b> Start your approach by taking three steps: a left-right-left sequence for right-handed hitters and the opposite for left-handed hitters. Steps should be explosive and quick, with the last step being longer and more powerful.</li>
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Timing:</b> Time your approach so that you reach the peak of your jump just as the setter releases the ball.</li>
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Jump:</b> Jump explosively off both feet, driving your arms to gain height. Aim to jump vertically as much as possible to maintain control and accuracy.</li>
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Arm Swing:</b> Bring your hitting arm back behind your head to generate power. Swing arm forward forcefully and snap wrist at the point of contact with the ball.</li>
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Arm Swing:</b> Contact the ball with the palm of your hand, using your fingertips to control the direction and trajectory of your hit.</li>

            <p>Blocking is a fundamental defensive skill where players jump to intercept the opponent's attack at the net, deflecting it back to their court.</p>

            <ul class = "list-group list_style mt-1">
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Positioning:</b> Stand at the net with your hands ready to jump vertically to block the opponent's attack. Position yourself in front of the hitter to close the blocking angle.</li>
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Jump Timing:</b> Time your jump with the hitter's attack, anticipate the trajectory of the ball and jump to reach the highest point of the block.</li>
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Positioning:</b> Extend both arms above the net and press your hands over the net to block the ball. Keep hands wide apart to cover more space and increase chance of blocking the attack.</li>
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Closing the Block:</b> Close the block by bringing your arms together as the hitter makes contact with the ball, sealing the block and minimizing gaps. </li>
              <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Footwork:</b> Use quick footwork to adjust position and angle for blocking. Video below elaborates more on this.</li>

                <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Grip:</b> Place your palm of your non-dominant hand underneath the ball and grip it with your fingertips.</li>
                <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Toss:</b> Toss the ball with your non-dominant hand in front of you and slightly upward, aiming for a consistent toss height. The toss should be located in line with your hitting shoulder and slightly in front of your body.</li>
                <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Contact:</b> Swing your dominant hand upward and forward in a smooth and controlled motion, making contact with the lower half of the ball. Strike the ball with the heel of your hand or the base of your palm to generate power and direction.</li>
                <li class = "list-group-item bg-light"><b>Follow Through:</b> After making contact with the ball, continue the motion of your serving arm upward and forward to ensure power and accuracy.</li>
