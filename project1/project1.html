                    <p class = "m-5 fs-5">The game of volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, a physical education director in at YMCA. Morgan wanted an alternative sport that was less strenuous than basketball and used the ball from basketball, the net from tennis, the use of hands from handball, and the innings from baseball to create "Mintonette", the original name for "Volleyball". Because the leather basketball was too big and heavy, many issues arose when playing such as increased risk of injury and a harder to control ball. In 1900, a distinct, lighter and smaller ball (the volleyball we know today) was created, further developing volleyball's presence in the world. After many modifications to the rules and the variations of the game, we now have the fun and unique sport that is played by hundreds of millions of people today.</p>
